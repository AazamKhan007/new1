            These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("You," "User") and  CampSum Global Enterprises  ("CampSum," "we," "us," or "our"). CampSum Global Enterprises is a Micro Enterprise registered in India under the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME). This document governs your access to and use of the CampSum platform, including our websites, mobile applications, software, and all associated services (collectively, the " Platform " or " Services ").
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            This document is an electronic record in terms of India's Information Technology Act, 2000, and the rules thereunder. By accessing, browsing, registering for, or using the Platform in any manner, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our  Privacy Policy , which is incorporated herein by reference. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not access or use the Platform.

          <p className="mt-4 text-sm text-gray-500 italic bg-indigo-50 p-3 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-indigo-400">
            The act of agreeing to these Terms alongside the Privacy Policy is a critical component of establishing a transparent and lawful basis for the processing of your personal data... By binding these two documents at the point of user agreement, CampSum creates a unified and legally defensible "consent event" that satisfies requirements under both contract law and data protection law.
          </p>

We will provide notice of significant changes by posting the revised Terms on the Platform or through other communication channels.
